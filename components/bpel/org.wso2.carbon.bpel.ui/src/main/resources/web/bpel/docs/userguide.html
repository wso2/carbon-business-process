<h1>WSO2 BPEL Component User Guide</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
    WSO2 Business Process component adds the capability to execute business processes written using
    WS-BPEL standard in WSO2 SOA platform. It also provides a complete web based graphical console
    to deploy, manage and view processes and process instances. WSO2 Business Process component is
    powered by Apache ODE(Orchestration Director Engine).
</p>

<h3>WS-BPEL</h3>

<p><a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/wsbpel/2.0/OS/wsbpel-v2.0-OS.html"
      target="_blank">WS-BPEL</a> defines a language for the specification of Executable and
    Abstract business processes. By doing so, it extends the Web Services interaction model and
    enables it to support business transactions. WS-BPEL defines an interoperable integration model
    that should facilitate the expansion of automated process integration in both the
    intra-corporate and the business-to-business spaces. Processes in WS-BPEL export and import
    functionality by using Web Service interfaces exclusively.

<h2><a name="processes">Processes</a></h2>

<p>In the management console, under <strong>Processes</strong> click <strong>List</strong>. The
    <strong>Processes</strong> page will
    appear.</p>
<img src="img/Processes.png" alt="Deployed Processes"/>

<p>Process list will display IDs of the deployed processes with their version, status, deployed
    date and the package they are contained in. With this list you can retire and activate processes. You can view
    detailed description
    about the process, when you click the process id link. By clicking the Package Name, you can view details, undeploy
    or download the package.</p>

<h3>Difference between Active and Retired Processes</h3>

<p>Active processes can be invoked by partners and as a result, new process instances will be
    created. When a process is retired all the running instances of that particular process will
    behave normally. But no new instances will be created from retired processes.</p>

<h3>Detailed View of Deployed Business Process</h3>
<img src="img/ProcessPage.png" alt="Process Details"/>

<p>In the management console, click <strong>List</strong> under <strong>Processes</strong>. Then click
    on any of the
    process ID links. It will display a detailed description about the process including version,
    status, deployed date, container package of that process, total instance, instance summary,
    syntax highlighted process definition and process visualization.</p>

<p>Using the link display in front of the <strong>Status</strong> of the process users can activate
    or retire that
    process.</p>
<img src="img/Status.png" alt="Process Status"/>

<p>Under <strong>Quality of Service Configuration</strong>, you can configure QoS for each
    partner-link used in the
    business process.</p>
<img src="img/QoS.png" alt="QoS Configurations"/>

<p>Under <strong>WSDL details</strong>, you create instances for the provided partner links and view
    their WSDLs.</p>
<img src="img/WSDL Info.png" alt="WSDL Details"/>

<h3>Deployment Descriptor Editor</h3>

<p>You can go to Deployment Descriptor Editor by clicking the link <strong>View or Edit Deployment Descriptor</strong>
    on any of the detailed process description pages. </p>
<img src="img/DeployEditorLink.png" alt="Link to Deployment Descriptor Editor"/>

<p>This editor allows BPEL process administrators to configure process/instance/scope event generation, instance cleanup
    at run-time.
    Also it provides the other configuration details like MEX interceptors, process properties, provided services
    (inbound interfaces)
    and invoked partner services (outbound interfaces). </p>
<img src="img/DeployEditor.png" alt="Deployment Descriptor Editor"/>
<h2><a name="instances">Instances</a></h2>
<img src="img/Instances.png" alt="Instance List"/>

<p>
    When you click Instances under Business Processes, <strong>Instances</strong> page will appear.
    This page will
    display paginated list of currently available process instances in the system.
</p>

<p>
    The instance list will display ID of the instance with the process id of that instance, current
    status, date started, last active date and actions that can be performed on that instance. Users
    can click on the instance id link to go to the detailed view of that instance and use process id
    link to view the details of the process. Users can use Suspend/Resume, Terminate and Delete
    links to suspend/resume active instance, terminate active instance and to delete instance from
    the system. Complete and Terminated instances can only be deleted and can't perform any other
    actions on it.
</p>

<h3>Instance Filtering</h3>

<p>User can filter the available instances according to their status. Advance Filter link will
    expand the filter from and users can use that to filter the instance list according to process
    name, process namespace, started date and etc.. If the user want to reset the filter and list
    all the available instances user can use either 'All' shortcut link or 'Reset Filter' link.</p>

<p>Advance Filter link will expand the filter form and user can use it to narrow down the instance
    list.</p>
<img src="img/AdvancedFilter.png" alt="Advanced Filter"/>

<h3>Instance Details Page</h3>

<p>When a user clicks on instance id link at the 'Instances Created' page, instance details page for
    the instance represented by that ID will appear.</p>
<img src="img/InstanceDetails.png" alt="Instance Details"/>

<p>Instance details page will display information like process id of that instance, status, last
    active date and event information, scope information, variable values and activity-event
    information of that instance. It will also include process instance details visualization with different abstraction
    levels</p>

<h3>BPEL Package Format</h3>

<p>BPEL package is a ZIP archived directory with all the relevant deployment artifacts. Minimal BPEL
    package contains the deployment descriptor, one or more process definitions(.bpel or .cbp), WSDL
    and XSDs(excluding the ones compiled into .cbp). The deployment descriptor is a file named
    deploy.xml. To deploy, just copy the BPEL package containing your artifacts to the
    %CARBON_HOME%/repository/deployment/server/bpel directory. If you are using a URL repository
    copy the package to 'bpel' directory in that repository.</p>

<h3>Folder structure of a BPEL Package</h3>

<h3>Deploying BPEL packages through the management console</h3>
<img src="img/AddBPEL.png" alt="Add New BPEL"/>

<p>
<ol>
    <li>In the management console, under Business Processes click Add BPEL. The <strong>Add
        BPEL</strong> page will
        appear.
    </li>
    <li>Click <strong>Browse</strong> to locate the file you want to upload.</li>
    <li>You can upload multiple files by clicking on the <strong>+</strong> sign</li>
    <li>Click <strong>Upload</strong>. If the BPEL package contains valid processes and adheres to
        the format, a
        message will appear saying the deployment was successful. If there are compilation failures
        in process definitions, a compilation error message will appear. In case of missing
        deployment descriptor, 'deploy.xml does not exist' message will appear. In this case
        management console will not automatically go to Processes page or Deployed Packages page.
    </li>
</ol>
